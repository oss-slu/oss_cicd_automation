# Work Description
During this sprint, I was tasked with identifying the reason behind the crash of an .exe file, which was developed by the individuals working in the OSS Speech Transcription Project. This file seemed to be working on a Mac machine but not on Windows. Before engaging in anything technical, I started by reading the README.md file on their GitHub repository and understanding the details of the project they were working on, the codebase, languages used, etc. I downloaded the .exe files to my local machine and tried opening them, and as expected, none of the .exe files were opening, which included the main speech transcription application.

# Individual efforts
As my first step, I began by checking the Windows Event logs to check whether I could obtain any important details regarding the crash of the .exe file. The Windows DCOM log entries (ContentDeliveryManager) didnt prove to be much useful in diagnosing the reason behind the issue of the crash and I decided to engage in deeper debugging. After this, I decided to fork the repository and cloned it to my local machine. I opened the project in Windows Command Prompt, created a Python 3.9 virtual environment, and tried opening the .exe file, which revealed Python runtime/DLL errors and file-not-found exceptions for package data files. This was a good starting point as I now had something to work with, mainly knowing the fact that this was a packaging/dependency issue with PyInstaller. In the command prompt, I installed the necessary packages from the requirements.txt file, but this was not enough. 

# Collaboration
After identifying the issues and resolving them by rebuilding the .exe file from scratch, I presented my work to my Team Lead through a Google Meet conversation, who was satisfied with the work I had done and also asked me to communicate with my team member regarding his progress. I ensured to communicate with my team member and he helped me with creating a Pull Request while ensuring that everything worked smoothly.

# Challenges
At every step, I tried opening the .exe file again, but this would result in ModuleNotFound errors. This meant that several other third-party packages needed to be installed externally, such as pattern and lightning_fabric which I installed promptly. Another package required the installation of MS Visual C++ Build Tools, and finally I tried rebuilding the .exe file using PyInstaller while bundling data and resource folders accordingly. This created a Python GUI.py file which opened from the command prompt, and when tested locally it was able to launch successfully.

# Professional Growth
Overall, this sprint was extremely helpful in terms of understanding how to investigate and resolve common issues like the crash of an .exe file on a local machine and how we can take active steps to ensure that this doesn't happen. While this required installing several dependencies, packages and rebuilding the executable file from scratch, I was able to diagnose and resolve the issue while also ensuring the project's long term stability for Windows users.
