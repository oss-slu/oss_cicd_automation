# Delivery Assessment
During this sprint, I successfully completed all tasks related to CICD and significantly improved the reliability and traceability of both the Speech Transcription system and the Drone World simulation. For the Speech Transcription system, the Mac build was functioning correctly, but the Windows executable consistently crashed on launch. To address this, I implemented logging in the GUI to capture runtime information and errors into app.log, updated the GitHub Actions workflow to store crash logs as artifacts, and resolved dependency issues in the requirements file that were causing installation and launch failures. These updates not only stabilized the Windows build but also allowed maintainers to access crash logs directly from the CICD pipeline without needing to run the application locally.


For Drone World, the situation was reversed the Windows build ran normally, but the Mac build failed. I configured a GitHub Actions workflow to build a Dockerized image, which ran successfully on Windows. While we have not yet tested the Dockerized build on Mac, it is expected to work correctly due to the containerized environment. Completing these tasks reinforced my ability to deliver reliable builds across platforms, maintain consistency in automated pipelines, and anticipate potential cross platform issues before they became blockers. Overall, my contributions ensured that both projects could be built, tested, and debugged efficiently, providing a strong foundation for future sprints.


# Collaboration Evaluation
Collaboration was a critical component of this sprint. I actively communicated issues with specific teams using Slack channels, providing detailed explanations of errors, reproducible steps, and potential solutions. By coordinating closely with teammates, I helped ensure that workflow updates and bug fixes were verified efficiently and implemented smoothly. This experience also helped me develop leadership and decisionmaking skills, as I frequently had to determine which issues to prioritize and propose solutions that balanced time constraints with technical requirements. Furthermore, collaborating across multiple teams highlighted the importance of clear, concise communication and proactive problem-solving, which are essential in a CICD development environment.


# Technical Growth
Technically, this sprint allowed me to strengthen several skills critical to software development and CICD management. Working with the Speech Transcription system improved my understanding of logging mechanisms, dependency management, and artifact handling within automated workflows. In Drone World, configuring Dockerized builds and ensuring compatibility across different operating systems enhanced my knowledge of containerization, environment management, and cross-platform testing. These challenges required careful debugging, critical thinking, and creative problem solving, particularly when resolving platform specific issues. Additionally, managing two complex projects simultaneously helped me develop a more structured approach to technical problem solving and anticipate potential risks in software builds and deployment.


# Professional Development
From a professional standpoint, this sprint enhanced my communication, time management, and leadership skills. I learned to explain complex technical issues clearly to both technical and nontechnical stakeholders and to provide actionable suggestions for team members when challenges arose. Balancing multiple projects in parallel strengthened my ability to prioritize tasks, manage time effectively, and maintain focus under tight deadlines. Documenting solutions, workflow updates, and troubleshooting steps not only supported team efficiency but also reinforced accountability and attention to detail. This combination of technical and interpersonal skills contributed to my overall growth as a professional and increased my confidence in handling high impact projects.


# Conclusion
Overall, this sprint was highly productive for my professional growth. I successfully completed CICD responsibilities for both projects, improved my debugging and critical thinking abilities, and strengthened leadership, decision making, and communication skills. The experience reinforced the importance of proactive problem solving, collaboration, and maintaining reproducible workflows across platforms. Moving forward, I aim to apply these lessons to enhance efficiency, anticipate challenges earlier, and collaborate even more effectively with cross functional teams, ensuring high quality delivery in future sprints. However due to working two projects in one sprint we decided for the CICD team to each take a project and if there is a obstacle that could not be solved we can ask each other for assistants. This way we can efficiently balance the workload and prevent both person working at the same task.
