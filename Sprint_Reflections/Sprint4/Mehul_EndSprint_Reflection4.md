# Delivery Assessment
During this sprint, one of my primary responsibilities was to improve the CI/CD readiness of the OSS Mouser project by focusing on dependency consistency and attempting to implement an automated Windows installer in their Github repository. I began by forking and cloning the repository locally, creating a dedicated branch, and a clean Python virtual environment. The requirements.txt file provided me with all the required dependencies for installation, and after installing these I documented my results. This process revealed that every dependency installed successfully on Python 3.13 (which is the version currently installed on my local machine), except for "playsound", which confirmed an existing compatability issue with newer Python versions. After collaboration with a developer currently working on the Mouser project, I shifted to using "playsound3", which installs in modern environments and results in a successful workflow on GitHub. I also validated that the application launches properly by running the command "python main.py" in VS Code, ensuring that no production functionality was broken. The app worked as intended with respect to UI and features.

A major deliverable for this sprint was the creation of a non-production impact CI workflow titled build-windows-sandbox.yml. As I did not want to modify existing production workflows, I scoped this as a sandbox pipeline in order for the Mouser team to safely experiment with PyInstaller builds and dependency configurations. This workflow was able to sucessfully install required dependencies, bypass the original playsound build failure and executes PyInstaller. Although a final .exe build was unable to be generated, this workflow provides a solid foundation the team can iterate on. Furthermore, all my work was contained to a sandbox branch to ensure that any code changes did not result in breaking production or existing CI chains.

# Collaboration Evaluation
In terms of collaboration, unfortunately much of the sprint work involved was technical and individual. While I communicated with the Tech Lead on outcomes and progress made, I was unable to schedule a call or meet in person since this week was extremely challenging in terms of exams and projects. However, the suggestion from the Mouser team's developer - such as switching from playsound to playsound3 were incorporated and ultimately resulted in a successful workflow. One area I identified for improvement is increasing frequency of check-ins, either through frequent communication on Slack or conducting Zoom meetings so that the team had more visibility. However, I ensured to communicate my findings and progress with the Tech Lead to ensure that all changes were reviewed.

# Technical Growth
With regards to technical growth, I was able to strengthen my understanding of GitHub Actions by building a non-production sandbox workflow, and also learning how PyInstaller bundles Python applications and how hidden imports, data files and metadata must be included. This sprint proved to be instrumental in helping me understand the complexities of creating installers for cross-platform GUI applications, especially when we consider how dependency versions, Python runtime behavior and packages behave differently across environments. Although the .exe build was not generated, I now have hands-on experience in diagnosing CI failures and testing reproductible build pipelines.


# Professional Development
In terms of professional development, this sprint improved my engineering practices with respect to delivering work which does not impact production. My pull request provides clear and concise documentation which ensures that maintainers can understand certain aspects like why playsound fails, how the sandbox workflow works and how to continue refining the installer. The work involved in this sprint involved debugging unfamilar tools, but I remained persistent to deliver high-quality work while strictly adhering to code safety.

# Conclusion
I strongly believe that my delivery was both safe and strategically valuable. I ensured that no code changes broke production code or existing CI chains, documented my findings clearly in concise pull requests and clarifying comments, and I provided the maintainers with a reproducible way to continue refining the build process. While the .exe build was not generated, we have moved from a state of no installer support towards a structured build process which can be completed in the next iteration.
