# Work Description
In this sprint, I focused on improving the reliability and maintainability of Project SpeechTagging by addressing logging, dependency management, and CICD workflows. Specifically, I added logging to the GUI to capture errors and runtime information, updated the GitHub Actions workflow to ensure crash logs are stored in app.log and uploaded as artifacts, and modified the requirements.txt file to resolve issues that were preventing the packaged exe file from launching successfully. 

# Individual Efforts
My contributions involved several technical decisions. First, I integrated Python's logging module into the GUI.py file so that key events, warnings, and exceptions are captured both to the console and to an external log file. This required designing a format that was readable and useful for debugging while avoiding it being too wordy. Next, I modified the GitHub Actions workflow to run the GUI in a headless mode during CICD and redirect logs to app.log. To ensure the log file is always available for review, I added an artifact upload step. Finally, I reviewed the requirements.txt file and identified problematic dependencies. I made a technical decision to remove wave entirely because I confirmed it was unneeded and would not affect the project at all. This, combined with adjustments to other dependencies, allowed PyInstaller to build the exe correctly.

# Collaboration
My partner was working on a separate task within SpeechTagging, specifically investigating why the exe was crashing. After testing and debugging, he also came to the conclusion that the issue was dependency related. This confirmation reinforced my own findings that the root cause of the crash was in requirements.txt. Having two independent investigations arrive at the same conclusion helped validate the fix and ensured confidence in removing unnecessary packages like wave. While we worked on different parts of the project, this cross validation was valuable and allowed us to move forward with a clear solution.

# Challenges
The most significant challenges I faced were dependency related. At first, even after removing certain packages from requirements.txt, pip continued trying to install MySQLPython due to indirect dependencies. This required troubleshooting which packages were triggering it and testing incremental fixes. Another challenge was making sure the PyInstaller build process succeeded in the GitHub Actions environment while also producing a functional exe locally. Headless GUI execution in CICD was another technical hurdle, since Tkinter applications can crash in environments without a display. I addressed this by adding an environment variable (HEADLESS = True) and conditional logic in the code to prevent the GUI loop from launching in CICD runs.

# Professional Growth
This sprint has been valuable for my professional development in multiple ways. I gained experience in dependency management and the importance of reproducible environments, particularly when using PyInstaller and GitHub Actions. I also improved my ability to debug issues that only appear in CICD pipelines, which required me to think differently about logging and test strategies. Working with structured logging helped me appreciate the role observability plays in software quality. More broadly, I am becoming more comfortable with the full lifecycle of changes from local development to CICD testing to packaging and deployment. These experiences are helping me grow as a professional who can contribute not just code, but also processes and infrastructure that make projects more sustainable for the entire team.
