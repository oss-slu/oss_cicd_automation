# Delivery Assessment
For this sprint, I worked on the OSS Rerum project to strengthen the CI/CD pipeline and improve its overall maintainability. Reflecting on the past 2 weeks of this sprint, I believe that I was able to make substantial contributions to this project which enhanced code quality, workflow automation and long-term sustainability. While this sprint is indeed over, I have registered for GWC x OSS maintain-a-thon in which I will again be making contributions to the Rerum project, thus enabling me to make more contributions and boost my collaboration with their team.

Firstly, I began this sprint by integrating ESLint and Prettier to the existing project repository, along with a GitHub Actions lint workflow file called lint.yml. To integrate ESLint and Prettier, I created multiple files which were .prettierrc.json, .prettierignore and eslint.config.js. This process involved configuring ESLint for a non-standard static web project, setting up appropriate browser globals, and fixing hundreds of existing warnings. However, by the end of the first week after submitting my PR, the entire repository successfully passed automated linting with a green CI check, which was an important milestone for Rerum considering that it had no automated code quality enforcement before. This proved to be crucial in improving consistency and readability across the codebase without making any alterations to any of its runtime logic.

For the second half of the sprint, I expanded the CI/CD work by improving overall developer and maintainer experience. I updated the .gitignore file to prevent large or unnecessary files such as node_modules/ and editor-specific folders from entering version control. I configured Dependabot for the project to automatically check for outdated npm packages and GitHub Actions once every week, ensuring long-term security and robustness. I also included README badges to provide visual status indicators for linting, Dependabot, and code style. Altogether, the value I was able to deliver this sprint was stable and ensured that I did not break production code. This was done with an attempt to make future contributions smoother and more reliable.


# Collaboration Evaluation
In terms of communication and collaboration, I worked on the contributions independently which I believe could have been improved significantly by communicating regularly with the Tech Lead of the project. Communication was often difficult due to my workload across classes which prevented me from keeping a meeting and discussing updates. While these are reminders to keep for the upcoming maintain-a-thon, I requested reviews for my PR and wrote concise explanations on the changes I incorporated for the project. However, moving forward, I would like to keep atleast one in-person meeting with the Tech Lead of Rerum and discuss my contributions with my friend who is working as a developer in the Rerum project. Such interactions can help distribute knowledge more effectively and ensure the team members are aligned with the work done

# Technical Growth
This sprint proved to be extremely important in refining my technical skill development, by helping me understand how to configure ESLint and Prettier, resolving complex linting issues involving globals, browser APIs and test files, setting up workflows, and improving repository hygiene. Troubleshooting ESLint errors was significantly challenging, however breaking down complex tasks into simple, achievable steps made the process smooth and efficient. 

# Professional Development
In terms of professional development, I was able to strengthen my time management skills by balancing early contributions (linting, workflows, etc) with later additions (Dependabot, badges, .gitignore improvements). By spreading work evenly across the sprint in each week, I was able to work efficiently and avoid high-risk changes. 

# Conclusion
I also learned how to fix hundreds of warnings, verify existing configurations before adding new workflows, and prioritizing non-production code breaking improvements, all of which helped prepare me to work in a real-world software development environment.
