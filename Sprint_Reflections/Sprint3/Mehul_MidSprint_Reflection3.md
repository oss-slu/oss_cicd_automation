# Work Description
During this sprint, my primary focus was to analyze the failing Jest test suite located in the templates/test.js file within the DigitalBonesBox project. My work contributed to improving the testing reliability and debugging practices within the project, making sure that the front-end logic and DOM behavior is verifiable through automated unit tests. It was also recommended that I should contribute to not only the unit test, but rather static, integration and security tests as well, all of which would hopefully be achieved in the coming sprints if time permits. However, for this sprint, so far I was involved in testing reliability and debugging, which is an important step in maintaining the repoitory's long term code quality and helping the team to identify environment-specific testing issues early in the CI/CD process.

# Individual efforts
With regards to the work accomplished, I was able to set up the local development environment and I installed the necessary dependencies. I also configured Jest for front-end testing under a JavaScript module-based project. This was followed by reproducing all the failing tests locally and I also engaged in a structured debugging process by using console.log statements within the test cases. This process allowed me to verify whether elements such as helpModal, helpButton and boneImage were correctly initialized and responding to simulated DOM events. This investigation led to a discovery that the failures did not occur due to logic errors in the application code, but rather due to jsdom environment limitations - how jsdom normalizes image source URLs, and fails to trigger event listeners bound to DOMContentLoaded. To validate these findings, I ran all the tests in-band and cross-checked the results against expected browser behavior. In order to ensure my work and debugging process didn't override existing code, I made sure to remove all the temporary debug statements and documented my findings in a clear and concise pull request on GitHub.

# Collaboration
Since collaboration is incredibly important when working in a sprint, I ensured to communicate with the project's Tech Lead and my Tech Lead as well before I engaged in such testing. While my primary goal was to create a unit test for this sprint (which still remains as a viable goal), I had to quickly pivot to debugging and diagnostics to ensure that I don't face any issues when creating tests. 

# Challenges
In terms of challenges, the jsdom testing environment simulated browser behavior only partially, leading to discrepancies between local test results and real-world browser execution. Instead of modifying source code, I relied on careful observation and controlled debugging experiments rather than direct code fixes. Running isolated tests and ensuring that the conclusions were evidence-based greatly helped me throughout this sprint.

# Professional Growth
Overall, this sprint was extremely important in helping me diagnose environment-specific bugs, and I also gained hands-on experience using Jest within a modular front-end project. I was also able to develop a structured debugging mindset - where I learnt to reproduce, isolate and document problems in a systematic fashion, which is an integral part of software engineering.
