# Case Studies
This folder contains technical case studies that document problem investigations, debugging steps, solutions, and results. Each case study focuses on a real issue encountered during CI/CD or application testing.

## Purpose
- Demonstrate analytical and debugging approaches
- Explain how system failures or test issues were identified and resolved
- Provide reproducible steps for maintainers and contributors

## What to Expect
Each case study may include:
- Problem summary
- Root cause analysis
- Tools and debugging methods used
- Reproducible steps
- Final fix or outcome

These case studies serve as practical learning resources for current and future developers working on the project.
