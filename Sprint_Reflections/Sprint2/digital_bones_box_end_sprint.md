# **Digital Bones Box – End of Sprint Reflection**

### **Work Description**

For this second sprint, I was tasked with creating the **foundational CI/CD setup** for the **DigitalBonesBox** project. To begin, I cloned the repository and reviewed the structure to understand how the application was organized and what testing, if any, was already in place. I scheduled a Google Meet with the project’s Tech Lead, who explained that the project currently lacked **organized testing practices** such as **unit, static, integration, and security tests**. While building a complete testing pipeline would require multiple sprints, she clarified that this sprint should focus on establishing a **baseline CI/CD structure** that future developers can build upon.

As a first step, I performed a **repository audit**, which revealed that there was only a **single linting workflow** and **no automated unit tests, dependency scanning, or deployment processes**. To address this, I created an **ADR-style audit report**, clearly documenting gaps and recommendations. This report was added to our CI/CD repository as a markdown file for future reference and planning.

In terms of implementation, I successfully:
- Integrated the **Jest testing framework**
- Added a dedicated `tests/` folder with a **sample Jest test**
- Expanded the existing GitHub Actions workflow to **run ESLint and Jest** automatically on every push and pull request
- Fixed multiple ESLint issues to ensure consistent code style
- Verified that linting and testing ran correctly both locally and inside GitHub Actions.

Although advanced testing (integration, E2E, security) has not been implemented yet, this CI/CD foundation will allow future contributors to extend test coverage easily and maintain higher project quality.

### **Collaboration**
Throughout the sprint, I maintained ongoing communication with my Tech Lead and the DigitalBonesBox project Lead. Through meetings, calls, and messages, I verified requirements, clarified expectations, and ensured that the audit writeup and CI/CD implementation aligned with project needs. This helped avoid rework and ensured my pull requests were structured correctly.

### **Technical Growth**
This sprint deepened my knowledge of:
- CI/CD fundamentals
- GitHub Actions workflow design
- Using **Jest** with front-end and DOM-dependent code
- Debugging failing tests in **jsdom** environments
- Applying **ESLint** to enforce consistent code quality
- Understanding **dependency warnings** and how they affect production vs. development builds

By resolving lint errors, analyzing security notifications, and debugging broken tests, I improved my awareness of **code quality and maintainability** in a real CI environment.

### **Professional Development**
Beyond the technical work, I strengthened my ability to:
- Write **clear developer documentation**
- Communicate issues and solutions in a structured way through PR descriptions and audit reports
- Manage time effectively by breaking tasks into smaller milestones
- Work collaboratively and respond to feedback

Overall, this sprint helped me evolve from just “running tests” to **understanding how CI/CD enables long-term project stability**. Establishing a working pipeline, adding tests, and documenting recommendations were concrete contributions that will support future development and onboarding. This experience improved my proficiency as a software professional and demonstrated how meaningful progress can be achieved even in complex, unfinished systems.
