# Code of Conduct 
 
1. Purpose 
Our community is dedicated to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and collaborative 
environment for everyone. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participant 
behavior and the consequences for unacceptable actions. Our goal is to foster an open 
and respectful atmosphere that encourages learning, contribution, and innovation. 
 
2. Our Standards 
We expect all participants to: 
• Be respectful and considerate in speech and actions. 
• Show empathy toward other community members. 
• Provide and accept constructive feedback gracefully. 
• Use inclusive language and avoid discrimination or harassment. 
• Collaborate in good faith to resolve conflicts. 
Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include: 
• Welcoming new contributors. 
• Recognizing and valuing diverse perspectives. 
• Gracefully accepting feedback and differing opinions. 
 
3. Unacceptable Behavior 
Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to: 
• Harassment, discrimination, or intimidation of any kind. 
• Offensive or disrespectful comments related to gender, identity, race, religion, 
disability, or orientation. 
• Personal attacks, trolling, or deliberate disruption of discussions. 
• Sharing others’ private information without consent. 
 
4. Enforcement Responsibilities 
Project maintainers and community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing 
this Code of Conduct. They have the right to take appropriate and fair corrective action, 
including warnings, temporary bans, or permanent exclusion from community spaces 
when violations occur. 
 
5. Scope 
This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces—both online and in person—and to 
all forms of contribution, including code, documentation, issue tracking, and discussions. 
 
6. Reporting 
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to the project 
maintainers or designated community leaders. All complaints will be reviewed promptly, 
kept confidential, and handled with respect. 
 
7. Acknowledgment 
This Code of Conduct is inspired by the Contributor Covenant (v2.1) and the Open Source 
Initiative’s community standards. By participating in this project, you agree to uphold 
these principles and contribute to a positive and inclusive open-source culture.
