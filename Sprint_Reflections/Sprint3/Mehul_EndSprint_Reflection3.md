# Delivery Assessment
For this sprint, I was tasked with stabilizing the testing and linting workflows for the OSS DigitalBonesBox project. While I was initially tasked with writing unit, integration, static and security tests, there were persistent Jest test failures for this project which I believe needed to be resolved first before I began writing any kind of tests. Thus, I had to ensure that CI/CD workflows could execute successfully without affecting production code.

After setting up the Jest testing framework in the previous sprint, I began the current sprint by reproducing the failing Jest tests locally and incrementally logging DOM states to understand why tests were failing. By conducting this process, I understood that the errors were a result of jsdom environment limitations as opposed to the project's logic/pre-existing code. Specifically, jsdom automatically normalized empty image src values to http://localhost/ and event listeners bound on DOMContentLoaded were not executed during Jest’s runtime. Through a process of validation by running controlled tests, I created a lightweight jest.setup.js file to simulate DOMContentLoaded events and prevent environment-based failures. I also made sure to stabilize the project's ESLint configuration by migrating from the deprecated .eslintignore to the new flat configuration format within eslint.config.js, which allowed the linting errors to be resolved smoothly and the project passed the command "npm run lint" successfully. Overall, even though I wasn't able to write the required tests, my deliverables were validated locally and through CI, and my pull request was merged successfully without affecting the application's runtime behavior. These updates improved code reliability and maintainability, which strengthened the project's overall infrastructure.


# Collaboration Evaluation
Collaboration, as observed in the earlier sprints, proved to be extremely valuable for this sprint as there was a lot of communication between me, my Tech Lead and the Tech Lead of the DigitalBonesBox project which provided me with a clear idea on what exactly I had to deliver for this sprint. Before implementing any configuration-related changes, I verified with the Tech Lead to ensure that no production-impacting files would be altered. We communicated frequently on Slack where we assessed whether our next steps were the right steps to proceed and how to ensure production code wasn't impacted. My pull request for this sprint was successfully merged, and I provided detailed documentation and explanations so future contributors can understand what was changed and why.

# Technical Growth
In terms of technical growth, I strengthened my knowledge of linting automation and how tools like ESLint and GitHub Actions integrate to maintain code consistency. I also refined my troubleshooting skills for interpreting Jest stack traces, using logging effectively and making non-invasive configuration changes.

# Professional Development
I also learned the importance of an essential principle in Software Engineering which is Test-Driven Development (TDD) and how to differentiate between logic changes and environment changes. After working in this sprint, I now have a stronger foundation for working with modern Javascript projects and continuous integration pipelines.

# Conclusion
Overall, this sprint was an exercise in clear and concise collaboration, documentation and troubleshooting. Its very easy to mistake environment-level issues as code logic errors, but by verifying assumptions methodically and structuring documentation, I was able to refine my software engineering skills. I also practiced effective time management by balancing testing, configuration changes and documentation while ensuring all updates were safely scoped.
